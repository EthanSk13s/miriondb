# Theater
A server that downloads and serves images for cards using a TCP connection between mirion and theater

## Why Rust?
Just for practice and experimenting.

Currently, this server isn't necessary as the main website relies on the matsurihi.me server for serving images. As this one becomes more developed, it will replace the current way the website gets images.
